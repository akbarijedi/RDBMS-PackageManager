# RDBMS-PackageManager
RDBMS-PackageManager helps you to easily deploy scripts(automatically deploys dependencies) to a RDBMS like .Net or nodejs package manager 

## Why we start zzz_sp_Deploy with zzz_
Because this way the stored producer located at the end of the producers list, 
so in a real project helper producers and functions will not cumbersome.
We recommend strongly start your general helper objects (tables,views,producers,functions) names with a zz_

- zz_tbl_ for tables
- zz_vw_ for views
- zz_sp_ for stored producers
- zz_fn_ for functions



## Roadmap
Implementing for Oracle, MySql, Postgres
